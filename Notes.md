# 1. What is JS?
JS is a high level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive.
It runs in the web browser and allows you to: 
-Add dynamic behaviour to websites(eg, animations, form validation).
-Manipulate the DOM(Document Object Model) to change the content of web page without reloading.
-Communicate with servers(APIs) to fetch or send data.

# 2. Setting up
You can write JS in:
-HTML file (inside <script></script> tags):
>>> <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is my webpage...............
    <script>
      console.log("Hello World!")
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
